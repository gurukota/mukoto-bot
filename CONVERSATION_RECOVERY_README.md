# Conversation Recovery & Error Handling Implementation

This implementation provides intelligent conversation recovery and error handling for the Mukoto WhatsApp bot. Here's what has been implemented:

## 🔧 **Components Created**

### 1. **ConversationRecoveryManager** (`src/utils/conversationRecovery.ts`)
- **Smart Error Detection**: Categorizes errors by context (payment, event, ticket, etc.)
- **Recovery Strategies**: Context-aware recovery paths for different scenarios
- **Retry Management**: Tracks and limits retry attempts per user
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler options when complex recovery fails

### 2. **Enhanced Error Classes** (`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`)
- **PaymentError**: Specific to payment-related issues
- **EventNotFoundError**: For event lookup failures  
- **TicketError**: Ticket generation/retrieval issues
- **NetworkError**: Connectivity and timeout problems

### 3. **Safe Operation Wrappers** (`src/utils/safeOperations.ts`)
- **safePaymentOperation**: Wraps payment calls with recovery
- **safeEventOperation**: Handles event-related operations
- **safeApiCall**: Network calls with timeout handling
- **safeSendMessage**: Message sending with fallbacks

### 4. **Enhanced Message Templates** (`src/utils/messages.ts`)
- **Context-aware error messages**: Different messages based on user situation
- **Recovery guidance**: Helpful suggestions for users
- **Progressive difficulty**: Escalates help based on retry attempts

## 🎯 **Recovery Strategies**

### **Payment Recovery**
When payment fails:
```
💳 Payment Issue Detected
It looks like there was an issue with your payment. Let me help you complete your purchase.

Options:
🔄 Retry Payment
💳 Change Method  
📞 Get Help
🏠 Start Over
```

### **Event Search Recovery**
When event lookup fails:
```
🔍 Let's Find Your Event
I noticed you were looking for events. Let me help you find what you're looking for.

Options:
🔎 Search Again
📂 Browse Categories
🎯 Popular Events
🏠 Main Menu
```

### **Ticket Recovery**
When ticket issues occur:
```
🎫 Ticket Issue
I see you were working with tickets. How can I help you?

Options:
🎟️ Buy Tickets
👀 View My Tickets
📧 Resend Tickets
🏠 Main Menu
```

### **General Confusion Recovery**
After multiple failed attempts:
```
🤔 Let me help you
It seems like you might be having trouble finding what you need. I'm here to help!

Options:
🎪 Find Events
🎫 Manage Tickets
💳 Payment Help
🆘 Talk to Human
```

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **1. Error Detection**
```typescript
// Automatic error categorization
const errorType = categorizeError(error);
// payment_error, event_error, network_error, etc.
```

### **2. Context Analysis**
```typescript
const context = {
  userId,
  userState,      // What they were doing
  session,        // Their session data
  lastAction,     // Previous action
  attemptCount    // How many times they've tried
};
```

### **3. Strategy Selection**
```typescript
// Find the best recovery strategy
const strategy = findRecoveryStrategy(context);
await strategy.action(context);
```

### **4. Graceful Fallback**
If recovery fails, the system:
- Offers human help after 3 attempts
- Provides simple "start over" options
- Logs everything for support team review

## 🚀 **Integration Examples**

### **In Webhook Handler**
```typescript
// Automatic recovery on any error
try {
  // Process user message
} catch (error) {
  await handleConversationError(
    error,
    userId,
    userState,
    session,
    lastAction
  );
}
```

### **In Payment Processing**
```typescript
// Safe payment operations
await safePaymentOperation(async () => {
  // Payment logic here
}, userId, userState, session);
```

### **In Event Search**
```typescript
// Safe API calls with timeout
const events = await safeApiCall(
  () => searchEvents(query),
  userId,
  userState,
  session,
  'Event Search API'
);
```

## 📊 **Recovery Statistics**

The system tracks:
- **Retry Attempts**: Per user, per session
- **Error Types**: Categorized for analysis
- **Recovery Success**: Which strategies work best
- **Escalation Triggers**: When users need human help

## 🎛️ **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before Implementation**
- Generic error messages
- Users stuck in failed states
- Lost conversation context
- Manual support needed

### **After Implementation**
- Context-aware help messages
- Smart recovery suggestions
- Maintained conversation flow
- Proactive problem solving

## 🔍 **Error Types Handled**

1. **Network Issues**: Timeouts, connectivity problems
2. **Payment Failures**: Declined cards, service outages
3. **Event Not Found**: Missing or deleted events
4. **Ticket Issues**: Generation failures, missing tickets
5. **Search Problems**: No results, service errors
6. **Session Issues**: Expired or corrupted sessions
7. **API Failures**: External service problems

## 🆘 **Support Integration**

When users need human assistance, the system:
- Provides the support email: **support@mukoto.app**
- Logs support requests for team review
- Sets user state to `awaiting_human_support`
- Provides clear contact information and response time expectations

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

1. **Reduced Support Load**: Users self-recover from common issues
2. **Better User Experience**: Contextual help instead of generic errors
3. **Maintained Engagement**: Users don't abandon conversations
4. **Intelligent Escalation**: Automatic human handoff when needed
5. **Learning System**: Improves based on user patterns

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The system is now ready to:
1. Handle complex error scenarios gracefully
2. Provide contextual recovery options
3. Learn from user behavior patterns
4. Escalate to human support when needed
5. Maintain conversation flow during failures

This creates a much more resilient and user-friendly conversational experience!
